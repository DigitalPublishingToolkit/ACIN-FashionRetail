    <Content>An interactive full-length mirror that allows your customers to browse through an endless collection of clothing that you offer and see immediately whether something fits them, including when they turn around, and which also allows them to quickly send a picture to their family and friends in order to hear what they think. This mirror is a technological development that is already possible and which is being launched in various fashion outlets. But how probable is it that this technological innovation will become a permanent feature of our shopping experience? How probable is it that a retailer will invest in such a mirror? To answer this question we shall describe the expectations regarding the developments in shopping in the next few years. We shall then examine to what extent these developments already play a role in shopping now, in 2015. In order to maintain clarity, we shall present a structured overview of innovations. All of the innovations mentioned are ultimately aimed at offering added value for the consumer, but who is the consumer and what does he or she need? An inventory of how the shopping consumer is viewed makes it clear that new perspectives are required in order to do justice to the complexity of shopping behaviour and the shopping experience. Finally, we will briefly examine specific cross-media aspects of shopping, such as the multichannel strategy of retail outlets and the role of the physical store in relation to the webshop. We end by explaining how researching the developments through the concept of servicescapes can answer a number of essential questions on the probability of innovations more systematically.</Content>

    <Content>We will enrich the developments we sketch and the arguments we use in two ways. Firstly, examples of current innovations are given throughout the text. Secondly, insights from interviews with Amsterdam fashion retailers are presented at the end of each main section. In 2014, students interviewed retailers in Amsterdam to ask about the future of fashion retailing. In total, 16 fashion retailers in various segments - from small boutiques to well-known international brands - were interviewed by students of the Amsterdam Fashion Institute. During these interviews, students were specifically interested in the usage of new and digital strategies to engage with (potential) customers. Four main insights and challenges for the near future were clearly highlighted by these interviews.</Content>

    <Content>The year 2020 is the new 2000. When we drew back the curtains on January the first 2000, we discovered that the world had changed completely. For hundreds of years we had speculated about what 2000 would look like and all of the possibilities that modern times and, specifically, technology would bring us. And finally we were able to see with our own eyes all of the future scenarios around us. On the first of January in 2020 our world will once again look different, even if it is just the way in which we shop (Shopping2020, 2013).</Content>

    <Content>The proximity of 2020 means that the predictions have a more realistic character compared to the science fiction associated with 2000. A number of those predictions are extrapolations of current developments that will almost certainly unfold over the coming years, in other words trends. Demographic developments are an example of this: an increase in the population of the Netherlands (17.1 million by 2020), the number of people over 50 that will be larger than the number of 20 to 49 year olds and the increase in the number of single person households (GfK, 2013). Although these are general trends they do have direct consequences for the retail sector: older people have specific wishes with regard to the delivery of goods ordered online and, because of the increase in single person households, the home delivery of goods ordered will become a bigger problem (Schut et al., 2014).</Content>

    <Content>Over the coming years, economic developments will also occur within a limited bandwidth. Expectations are that there will be virtually no growth in consumer expenditure (Wolters, 2013; Erich, 2014), spending power will stagnate or drop, more international players will join the Dutch market, and the retail offering on the periphery will become leaner (GfK, 2013). This not only means that consumers will primarily base their choices on price and that they will mainly be interested in new services that can save them money (DigitasLBi, 2014), but it also means that investments in the retail sector will decline or only be made by the major players in the market. And major players or retail chains behave differently in the market compared to small independents, with all of the consequences this entails for the development of retail as a sector. And that is before we consider the increasing number of empty retail premises, which is expected to increase from 6.3% to 10% by 2020 (Shopping2020, 2013).</Content>

    <Content>In the predictions there are major uncertainties, for instance about the role of ecological developments (the role of sustainability, 'green' policies) and political developments (including privacy legislation, rental legislation for retail premises and opening hours policy). However, technology remains the best subject for the party game in which we envisage the situation in the (near) future. Technology and what that will bring us plays a recurring and leading role in all kinds of speculation about retail developments (e.g. Hofste &amp; Teeuw, 2012; GfK, 2013; Shopping2020, 2013; PWC, 2014; Shopping2020, 2014b).

    <Content>Big data is the analysis of linked databases in order to provide new insights. The integration of (real-time) structured data (for example payment transaction data) and unstructured data (for example, social media sentiment about a brand) is the Holy Grail of being able to understand patterns in the customer journey, the ability to identify trends and new target groups and for building up a profile of each customer so that the range of products on offer and the prices can be adapted in real time.</Content>

    <Content>Bra shopping; it takes a lot of time, patience and awkward moments when the sales person wants to measure your exact bra-size. So wouldn’t it be great if there was a solution for all this? Lincherie claims to have it! The Dutch lingerie label Lincherie launched a new technique for measuring the bra-size of customers in a fast and precise manner in one of their Amsterdam stores. You no longer need staff assistance when you want to know your exact size. How does it work? A 3D body scanner is hidden in a mirror inside the fitting room. The mirror itself tells the customer to spread their arms slightly and spin slowly. In less than a minute it takes 140 measurements of the upper body. The customer then receives her exact bra-size. Besides all of this, the mirror can also give customers information about what’s in stock. Lincherie’s store manager claims that this mirror makes lingerie shopping less frustrating for women who are particularly shy .</Content>

    <Content>The 3D printing trend is seen as the future disruption to the production chain because customers can print (parts of) a product themselves without the intervention of a manufacturer or supplier, apart from the 3D model design. The phase of 3D printing of gadgets and miniatures is slowly coming to an end and 'normal' products are increasingly forming part of what is available: at Shapeways.com it is possible to order a 3D printed bikini. For fashion retail, it appears that the development of 3D scanning is a trend that is just as important. Because measurements are different in each country and for each brand it is often difficult for consumers to find clothes that fit properly without actually trying them on, and all of the consequences this entails (such as returns for online orders). A 3D scanner performs a 360-degree scan of a person’s body, on the basis of which advice is given on the sizes of the different brands to be chosen (for example, see </Content>

    <Content>Much is expected of wearables (Shopping2020, 2014b). There is a great deal of press interest in wearable virtual reality (Google Cardboard, Oculus Rift). An increasing number of major names such as Samsung and Apple are, for instance, focusing on smart watches. Although these examples are the most high profile, wearables also include sensors in shoes and clothing. These sensors can be used to provide more information about an article of clothing when held up in front of an interactive mirror in the store or they can be given a health monitoring function – from step counters in training shoes to sensors in clothing that measure heart rate, blood sugar and emotions. It remains to be seen which of these will be truly useful, for example the vibrating 'HAPIfork' that uses Bluetooth to monitor whether you are eating healthily by recording how quickly you eat (see </Content>

    <Content>The Affair, funded by Kickstarter, introduce with their new collection ’1984′ the UnPocket™ stealth technology that secures your phone, passport and bankcards with police-grade high performance shielding to ~100 dB. In other words: you become untrackable and unhackable. UnPocket is a stealth pocket that securely blocks all Cellular, WiFi, GPS and RFID signals. A whole collection of clothes is built around these removable and water resistant pockets, so you can carry devices with you in style. People can be tracked easily because of the GPS or WiFi on their phone. Personal data on your contactless bank card or e-passport can be stolen or skimmed. This can be prevented, according to The Affair, by using UnPocket. Just pop your phone, passport and bank cards in the pocket and you become invisible to Big Brother. The Affair-1984 state on their website that their goal is to create: “Fashion for an under-surveillance society. Because let’s face it, Big Brother knows way too much already…”</Content>

The initial performance of these types of commercial products dates back to 1998 by the Japanese firm V-Sync (with a Pentium II processor!). In this case it seemed that science fiction followed the current events with an appearance by a ‘smart’ refrigerator in the film 'The 6th day', released in 2000. These days, the smart refrigerator is the example that is cited when underlining the fact that technology can be way off target: &quot;Truth is, no one wants to communicate with their fridge. No one wants the obligation of keeping their fridge informed unless they're seriously short on inter-personal relationships.&quot; (</Content>

Perhaps it is indeed not necessary at all that every object has to be connected directly to the Internet since the possibility of uniquely identifying an object via a barcode, QR code or through augmented reality and thus be able to retrieve additional information via the Internet, is probably sufficient for discovering whether we are buying a piece of healthy meat, whether the item of clothing is cheaper elsewhere or whether your friends enjoyed reading a certain book.</Content>

    <Content>Another long-term technological development or discussion is the one concerning Trusted Identity - the ability to establish the identity of a person in a safe and reliable manner both online and offline. This development is, of course, very important for payments and the new payment methods that are being created such as via Near Field Communication (NFC). However, it also plays a role within the framework of, amongst other things, personalisation and loyalty programmes. Knowing what one and the same person does online and in-store can result in a much better personalised offering. Convenience is the name of the game because, for example, standard information does not need to be entered for every webshop or because multiple devices are required for payments (cash, cash/chip card, switch card, credit card, mobile, Bitcoin, etcetera). Behind Trusted Identity there are major discussions taking place about technological infrastructure, security, fraud and privacy, which also affect more legal principles such information ownership or more moral principles, such as who ‘owns’ your DNA profile.</Content>

    <Content> the customer. In the byAMFI store in Amsterdam we tested the effect of sending information to customers on their shopping experience via beacons. Every time a customer approached a certain collection, he or she received extra information about that collection on a mobile phone. The beacons provided text and photographs about the designer and the concept behind the collection. Customers who were interviewed responded partially positively to this manner of information transfer. They said, for example, that they think that this manner of information provision suits not only the store, but also the future. They wished that more stores had a system like this. One of the interviewees even said that she was willing to pay more for the clothes now she knows more about the concept behind the garments. Another claimed that she really liked receiving information in this manner, because she loves to shop anonymously and using the beacons meant that she did not have to ask the staff for extra information. Besides these positive reactions, there was also criticism: “You have to have time in order to use this app. If you don’t have time, the app can be annoying”; “I prefer to decide for myself about which garment I want to receive more information and about which garment I don’t.” The study's overall result of the survey is that the group of customers that shopped with the app perceived the store’s atmosphere in a significantly more negative manner than the group that shopped without the app. Also, customers who used the app where significantly less willing to recommend the store to others than customers who did not use the app. Despite some of the positive reactions of customers, there were no positive effects of beacons found in this study (Moes &amp; Van Vliet, in press). A clear indication that technological innovations do not necessarily lead to a more positive shopping experience.</Content>

Alex &amp; Ani, an American fashion retailer focusing on authentic jewellery, gave it a try. The main goal for Alex &amp; Ani to use iBeacon was to get consumers into the store who are not familiar with the brand – something many brands strive for. Additionally, it is expected that the software will create a rich profile of shoppers’ browsing and purchasing behaviour.

    <Content>A common way of still being able to obtain a clear picture of (uncertain) future developments is to draft scenarios. A very common form of this is to take a development with an uncertain direction, for example, how people will deal with their possessions in the future. Two extremes are then formulated, for example, 'buying will continue as usual' or 'there will be an economy based on bartering and sharing'. When this is done for two developments these axes can be intersected in a coordinate system, which produces four possibilities that can be further defined. Here we describe two of these types of scenarios for the retail sector: one focuses on retail in general, and one focuses on fashion shopping patterns facilitated by technology.</Content>

    <Content>Four scenarios emerge when we intersect these two uncertainties (Figure 1). The first scenario, a thriving collaborative economy is about consumers having access to services and products that they wish to use, which they do not necessarily have to own, but which they can hire and use on a temporary basis. This can be for reasons of convenience or because of sustainability considerations. In the price-conscious collaborative economy (scenario number 2) the power of the collective is used to negotiate good deals through collective purchasing and agreements relating to, for example, energy and insurance. Products, such as cars, are also shared because it is less expensive to do it that way. Objects are also shared between people because this makes good economic sense (see </Content>

In the third scenario, price-conscious self-society, the main aim for the individual consumer is to find the best deal, and it makes no difference whether it is a different supplier or a different brand each time.

    <Content>Both axes are, in fact, not chosen very well. The first axis does not so much describe an uncertainty but two different ‘consumers’ (see discussion below). For the second axis, the outcome was already known at the time of publication in 2012: yes, the shopping process is changed even just by using a smartphone in the shop (to compare prices), or for advance online orientation (comparison sites). This is, therefore, far from being an uncertainty, already a reality (in 2012).</Content>

    <Content>Four more possible scenarios can also be generated on the basis of these two axes (Figure 1). In the first scenario, the 'Augmented Shopping experience', the consumer’s experience is central. The store makes optimum use of virtual techniques in order to show how the personally selected clothing suits you. Interactive full-length mirrors, 3D models and virtual catwalks intensify the experience. In the 'Personal shop experience' scenario the consumer buys as they currently do, but the store is enriched with extra experience moments through smell, sound and visual stimulants matched to personal aspirations. For 'Virtual shopping', technology is used to enable the consumer to make a selection from a large range by creating a virtual fitting room and the ability to show the choice immediately to friends via a Tweet mirror. In the last scenario, that of the 'Social shopper', social media play an important role in the buying process, both online and offline. Review sites and the opinions of family and friends are consulted in order to decide what to buy. Brands and shops monitor this and try to influence it and to learn from their customers by analysing thoughts and statements.</Content>

    <Content>Weltevreden (2012) identified four phases in the evolution of online shopping. In the first phase, between 1994 and 1999 only 16% of people in the Netherlands had access to the Internet at home. In this period, the vast majority of the activities consisted of surfing the net and using e-mail. Retail chains and mail order firms in particular had websites, although only 4% also used the website as a sales channel. The website during this period was mainly used as a referral to the store (opening times, location). There was virtually no online shopping: in 1998, only 2% of the Dutch population bought via the Internet. By 2003, this had already risen to 31% due to a substantial growth in the number of households that became connected to the Internet between 1999 and 2003: around 68%, of which one-third was already using a broadband connection. By this time, an increasing number of retail chains and independent retailers had a website, which was used to provide more information about products and services and for e-mailing newsletters to keep customers informed and to build loyalty.</Content>

By 2009 more than two-thirds of the Dutch population were shopping online, and the amount of spending online and the average amount spent was increasing substantially. This period showed the mass emergence of (smaller) web-only firms, which resulted in a threefold increase in online sales. However, the traditional retail sector lagged behind when it came to developing webshops: only 18% of the retail chains and only 6% of the independent retailers had a webshop in 2006.</Content>

By developing what is known as an, ‘immersive’ 3D environment, users can walk virtually through the supermarket and order their items. In this way, shoppers do have the experience of being in a store, but don’t have to actually go there and queue up to get their products. Keytree works with Kinect technology, thereby making it possible to navigate through the environment without using a mouse or PC. Rather, your body becomes the console.

    <Content> The expectations differ considerably for each product category. The biggest growth is expected in the product categories that were already doing well online in 2012: event tickets, package holidays, individual flight tickets and accommodation and insurance are expected to increase from the current 50% to between 70% and 80% of the share of online sales. For fashion, according to the experts, the current share of 10% of online sales will increase to 27% for both clothing and shoes &amp; personal lifestyle (Wolters, 2013). An estimate that can also be found in a recent ING report on shopping domains (Erich, 2014). The same pattern, but with different figures, can be seen when consumers are asked about the products that they will no longer be buying in a physical store in 2020. The top of that particular list has the same product categories stated by the experts: event tickets, package holidays, individual flight tickets and accommodation and insurance. Around 40% of consumers say that they will no longer be going to physical stores for these products. For fashion, the number is considerably lower: 17% (shoes and personal lifestyle) and 12% (clothing) (Peters &amp; Witte, 2013).</Content>

    <Content>Besides online shopping, there is another interesting development happening in the world of online fashion. Fashion apps and fashion blogs are becoming more and more popular. Fashion apps are applications that offer a shopping and/or inspirational platform for the app user. Like other apps, these can be downloaded onto smartphones from an app store (Magrath &amp; McCormink, 2013). These days, fashion blogs function as a central platform where fashion-related news and information circulates (Rocamora, 2012). Fashion blogs can inspire their readers. Advertisements that are ‘hidden’ in the blogs can affect consumer’s (brand) attitude and shopping behaviour. These blogs have the ability to create a strong personal relationship with their readers. Advertisements viewed in such a personal and non-intrusive context can influence consumers in a more subtle way than traditional media can (Halvorsen et al., 2013).</Content>

Because of their influence, fashion blogs can function as a marketing communication tool for retailers. A recent study by Maaike Driessen revealed some interesting results. A survey answered by 108 fashion blog readers, showed that fashion blogs influence the shopping behaviour of consumers. Apparently, 93 percent of fashion blog readers bought something after they saw it in a fashion blog. Besides this, the results show that fashion blog readers are influenced by product reviews and they are more likely to buy something after they have seen it in a fashion blog.</Content>

    <Content>In September 2013, the Cross-media research group of the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (AUAS) in collaboration with the Amsterdam Fashion Institute (AMFI) started a study on innovations in fashion retail on the basis of two fundamental principles. The first fundamental principle concerns the method of classifying all occurrences observed, for which a mix of a taxonomy and a typology was chosen. A taxonomy is a systematic classification of aspects based on observations. By observing multiple occurrences, many of their aspects can be classified into similarities and differences. The result is often a hierarchical classification, such as the taxonomy of species in flora and fauna. Whilst a taxonomy starts on the basis of observed occurrences, a typology starts on the basis of a concept. The distinctive properties that potential occurrences could normally possess are devised and the actual occurrences are then classified in accordance with these rules. We then talk about 'types’ as opposed to 'kinds’, as in the case of a taxonomy. One can say that taxonomies are created empirically or inductively and that typologies are created conceptually or by deduction. In order to make an inventory of the innovations in fashion retail we have opted to work at the highest level using conceptual classification (typology) and then to use two levels 'below' that have resulted in ‘kinds’ of innovations on the basis of observations (taxonomy). The decision to work at the highest level using a typology arises from the framework that has been developed for examining new services by the cross-media research group (see Van Vliet, 2014).</Content>

  <CharacterStyleRange AppliedCharacterStyle="$ID/NormalCharacterStyle">
    <Content>The second fundamental principle concerns the typology to be used for the innovations. We have opted for the STOF model as it is a well-founded framework in business model innovation research. The STOF model is part of the STOF methodology, a design method for business models. The STOF model describes business models on the basis of four associated domains: the Service domain (the added value of the service), the Technology domain (the technical functionality and architecture required in the service), the Organisation domain (the network of parties involved and the processes for delivering the service) and the Financial domain (the method of income generation and the sharing of risks, investments and income amongst the various actors in the network). It is from these four domains that the methodology derives its name (Haaker, 2012).</Content>

    <Content>Most of the interviewed retailers do have a – still simple – webshop. Some because they want to make sure that they have an online presence, while others really see it as a way of increasing sales. However, most retailers struggle with how to handle this effectively: making sure that people find your website and are seduced to buy your products on it. Retailer T: “Recently, I asked two boys, with no knowledge of what I was doing, to buy a pair of jeans from our webshop. And after doing so, they said that it was unclear to them whether or not they could actually buy a pair of jeans on our website. So for them, it was a website, not a web</Content>

    <Content>. This really triggered me; it is so easy to become blind in this business.

Hopefully, it has now become more clear that we also run a webshop” (idem).</Content>

<ParagraphStyleRange AppliedParagraphStyle="ParagraphStyle/Paragraph">
  <CharacterStyleRange AppliedCharacterStyle="$ID/NormalCharacterStyle">
    <Content>Looking at the future of fashion stores, retailer T has only one thing to say: “It will all be about online and digitalisation, like, marketing wise. The paper era is blowing its last breath. [..] I mean, this is relevant to all retailers. In the end, you want to remain profitable. Paper advertising is a tradition of ours, but it is hard to tell conversion rates. If I buy 100,000 books to sell in my store, I do want to make sure that enough customers will buy them” (personal conversation, 2014). He therefore pays a lot of attention to his website and SEO optimisation. Adding the right text, and the right links. “My goal is to appear in the top ranking in Google within one month. So if we have a new collection, I make sure that I announce it well, that everybody knows about it when searching for it. This is where the main part of the marketing budget goes to” (idem). Other retailers confirm this challenge: if people look for certain brands or fashion items, they want to make sure they are found quickly. But how to do that, remains a big task, especially when marketing budgets are limited.</Content>

    <Content>The service domain concerns the added value that a service or product provides for the customer. A great deal is expected of personalisation, in other words, the customising of the service or product for a particular individual so that a more or less unique service or product is created. The most literal interpretation of this is tailor-made clothes and the independent creation of, for example, a Louis Vuitton bespoke handbag from The Haute Maroquinerie in Bond Street in London. Personalisation is not just about creating a unique product or service; it also relates to finding an appropriate or unique product or service for an individual. Recommendations for you, the customer, based on your previous purchases or based on preferences of people with similar tastes can be found in many webshops. Another example is </Content>

Personalisation is also about customising the information about the service or product by taking into account the specific moment (morning rush hour, Wednesday afternoon, during Sunday opening hours, et cetera) and the precise location (in-store, en route, at home, et cetera). This personalisation can be improved by gathering as much information as possible about the customer: from buying trends via store cards and online click and buy patterns on PC, tablet, Smartphone and Smart-TV to personal information (zip code, e-mail address) and all kinds of sensor information (how you move around the store, what you look at, what products you pick up or take to the fitting room, et cetera). This combination of data can then be used to persuade the customer with targeted special offers or by adapting advertisements on TV, online, in magazines or on billboards in real time, as depicted in a scene in the film </Content>

    <Content>Buyosphere was a fashion advice community where one could browse style guides that were created by members of the community or simply ask advice on where to find something that is exactly what the consumer was looking for. Born out of personal frustration with finding unique products online, Buyosphere focused on finding that exclusive item that consumers couldn’t seem to find using traditional methods. As Buyosphere said : “Our goal is to create the best and most unique content through user curation – unearthing unique designers and products you won’t find through a traditional search.” With Buyosphere, shoppers could sign up for the Fashion Advice Community that enabled users to 1) ask questions to get help in finding that perfect item, 2) check style guides of other members and 3) save those items that customers love to their personal profile, thereby also having the ability to share these items with their personal network. Becoming an editor – an active member who is, for instance, able to create style guides that can function as an inspiration to others – was also one of the options Buyosphere offered. In this role, one could (as already mentioned) create style guides, be featured on the homepage and in newsletters and get a special profile where one could build a personal fashion magazine and style portfolio. The failure of Buyosphere proves that not all new interactive communities are a guarantee for success.</Content>

    <Content>However, research shows that only 14% of consumers want a personalised offering, 42% do not and 44% are undecided (Peters &amp; Witte, 2013). Of consumers, 77% also say that they do not wish to be identified when entering a store in order to be presented with a personal shopping experience. One possible explanation for this is fear amongst consumers about what happens with their data. Of those questioned, 67% were willing to share information with the retailer in order to be presented with relevant offerings but did not want their details to be shared with other parties. That makes it difficult to create an overall profile of a person and personalisation therefore remains restricted to a brand, store, social media platform, app or webshop despite the fact that benefits are to be had, including for the customer, by making information available to other suppliers about a person’s preferences. Musical preference (iTunes downloads, Spotify playlists, radio listening pattern) is, for example, not an isolated feature of an individual but is related to all kinds of preferences. The North &amp; Hargreaves (2007) study shows that musical preference is associated with choices of particular newspapers, radio stations, TV channels, TV programmes, magazines, books, the amount of time spent reading and the preference for certain leisure activities. In that sense music preference says something about a person’s lifestyle. It is not unimaginable that a fashion webshop can recommend something relevant to a customer based on that customer’s music preference.</Content>

    <Content>The fact that there are other views about experience and shopping apart from the purely technological aspect can be found in the study undertaken by Erdman (2008). He tried to devise a number of design principles for adding experience to shopping areas so that their distinctive capacity would increase. He based this on, amongst other things, the well-known Pine &amp; Gilmore theory on the Experience Economy (Pine &amp; Gilmore, 1999). In that theory, Pine &amp; Gilmore derive a number of design principles for creating experiences.

    <Content>One final remark on experiences is necessary. In Van Vliet (2012) it is already stated, as a result of reviewing the Pine &amp; Gilmore theory, that strong doubts can be raised about the unilinear process of economic evolution advocated by Pine &amp; Gilmore, in which 'experiences' are a fourth step in the escape from the 'commodity trap'. The few historical examples that were referred to in Van Vliet’s study (2012) as counter-example can now be supplemented further by examples from the retail context. In the 1930s, Carl W. Dipman described a number of future visions on the development of food retail, in which recurring aspects are self-service and &quot;shopping is to be an </Content>

Furthermore: &quot;In the late eighteenth century Oxford Street had already been described as a 'dazzling spectacle' of 'splendidly lit shop fronts' and 'alluring' and 'handsome' displays.&quot; (Nava, 1997, p. 64). Even more important than a vision and an illustrative example is that particular experiences were 'produced' and perceived around the turn of the 19th to the 20th century, the most iconic example of these being department stores. Department stores were more than just a place for doing your shopping; they formed a new public venue for displaying modernity and were visited as tourist attractions. The Selfridges department store was regarded, like Westminster Abbey and other places, as one of the biggest attractions in London. One of the Selfridges advertising slogans was: &quot;Shopping at Selfridge's: A Pleasure - A Pastime - A Recreation&quot;. Department stores were 'fantasy palaces', luxuriously built from marble, iron ornaments, large open staircases, parquet flooring and silk and leather furniture. They were the first public places that used electric lighting, and not just for illuminating but also for the theatrical effects. Everything was configured for service and having fun whilst shopping, supported by unique spaces for children, restaurants, roof terraces, zoological gardens, ice-skating tracks, libraries, galleries, travel agencies, banks and all manner of services for delivering your purchases to your home. And that wasn’t everything: &quot;In their display of goods and use of colour, they often drew on the convention of theatre and exhibitions, continually innovating in order to produce new, vivid and seductive environments, with </Content>

    <Content>Finally, there are also technological innovations in the area of smartphones that are worth mentioning. Virtual reality has, for instance, become possible through the use of a certain app in combination with the Google Cardboard. We created this type of app where anyone with a smartphone and a Google Cardboard can virtually ‘walk’ through the byAmfi store in Amsterdam, wherever they are (Riester &amp; Van Vliet, 2014). You can stand in six different places in and around the store and literally look around. A voice-over will guide you through the store at the pace you decide. Augmented reality via the smartphone is also used to boost the consumer experience and to provide additional information about a product. The latter is a common use of the smartphone: whether it is by scanning QR codes, via Bluetooth (beacons) or RFID, the smartphone is a commonly used device for providing consumers with personalised extra information or for informing them about special offers. This additional information is often combined with information about the consumer’s location (</Content>

For example, a few years ago Wehkamp was able to launch a campaign that gave consumers a 10% extra discount on Wehkamp products if the consumer was in a competitor’s physical store, for example in the Mediamarkt, at that moment (Hofste &amp; Teeuw, 2012).

    <Content>) consumers are 165% (!) more likely to buy a product when it includes an AR marketing component. The type of AR ad that we are talking about here is an ad as we know it: a picture in, for example, a magazine. Only with AR, consumers can point the camera of their phone at the ad. The camera then searches for ‘recognition marks’ to identify the object in the picture. As it does this, it shows the content that is linked to the information on the phone’s screen, such as a shoe collection, or the possibility to see a dress in multiple colours, as a layer over the actual photo. Most of the time one needs an app that enables the possibility to recognise the products. From this perspective, the process is the same as with a regular QR-scanner: scan the item and then extra information will appear. The extra information in the case of AR-technology contains a ‘pop-up’. One can suddenly see a 3D version of a product, or one can pick different colours for a certain outfit.</Content>

    <Content>The level of prominence of smartphone usage in the consumer’s current buying process is apparent from, among others, the DigitasLBi study (2014). Around two-thirds of Dutch consumers stated that using a mobile phone has had a significant impact on the buying process. For example, 90% of consumers use their mobile phone to search for more information about a product when they are at home, at work or school, and around 40% do this when they are in the store. So as a retailer it is worth considering how to create a valuable experience for your customers with smartphones. The mobile phone is used in the store to search for information, to compare prices and to ask the opinion of friends and family about the products. The Snaptell app, for example, allows you to take a photograph of a book, CD or videogame and then shows reviews and ratings for the product. Purchases made by mobile phone are lagging behind somewhat; around 18% of consumers have bought something via the mobile phone during the last three months.</Content>

    <Content>We can see comparable results in the Kilcourse &amp; Rowen study (2014): one-third of customers use their mobile phone in the store and do so mainly for price comparison (62%) followed by product ratings and reviews (45%) and improved online choice (39%). Williams (2014) writes about more than half of the consumers using a mobile device in the store, primarily for comparing prices. Of those consumers, 36% visit the retailer’s website or app for the store in which they are located at that moment. A Google study (Google, 2013) also reveals the advance of the smartphone in the shopping process: 90% of the smartphone users asked said that they use the smartphone before shopping (finding store locations, opening times, price comparison, special offers, browsing catalogue) and 84% use the smartphone in the store; for clothing this is 80%. The most important activity on the smartphone in the store is price comparison, although this is more prevalent for appliances and electronics (&gt;70%) than for clothing (44%). Search engines are mainly used for this and, in second place, the store’s website. The study also finds that consumers who use smartphones frequently in the buying process spend 25% more money compared to consumers who only use smartphones for this purpose occasionally.</Content>

    <Content> (Velti, 2013). The latter can, for example, be via an 'opt-in' procedure where the customer can decide whether or not to receive coupons. These expectations are not only based on the increasing use of smartphones, but also on the fact that the smartphone is experienced as being personal and the retailer has the possibility to ‘follow’ the consumer everywhere: &quot;Retailers can now enter the consumer's environment through the mobile device, and, because the mobile device stays with the consumer, the retailer can be anywhere, anytime&quot; (Shankar et al., 2010, p. 112). There is, however, a shift taking place in the belief that mobile devices not only have to have a function for attracting the consumers to the store but that they also have to be seen as a channel that must support the entire sales process, including in the store: &quot;Mobile's role is to bind the digital and physical selling environments together in a meaningful way for consumers.&quot; (Kilcourse &amp; Rowen, 2014, p. 22). The main reasons why retailers and advertisers are lagging behind are: budget and knowledge as well as mistrust on the part of consumers about (push) marketing (Shankar et al., 2010; Velti, 2013; Kilcourse &amp; Rowen, 2014).</Content>

    <Content>In our study, conducted by students, into the use of technology in 60 fashion retail stores in Amsterdam, we also found little evidence of all of the technological possibilities (Schrandt, Riester &amp; Van Vliet, 2014). The stores rarely use any of the current digital opportunities. Products are mainly promoted using flyers, bags and posters. Feedback from customers is mainly obtained via forms. Interactive screens are the most common form of digital expression although here too only one-third of the shops studied made use of this. Visitors are being asked to visit the website/webshop (for example by printing the URL on the till receipt). The websites/webshops of the shops studied often contain the same information that people would encounter in the store. Cautious use is being made of technologies such as 3D visualisations, but this is somewhat limited. The most important technologies being used are search functions and viewing catalogues using zoom functions for photographs. In some cases (one-third) it is also possible to leave feedback and view other reviews, but that too is only on a limited scale. As regards mobile phones, one-third of the shops have an Android app and almost half have an iPhone app. However, you are hardly ever asked to install the app in the store or on the website. This small-scale study therefore seems to confirm the statement: &quot;There is a vast distance between retailers' understanding of the value of many of today's technical solutions and actual use - even though many of those technologies have been available for quite some time&quot; (Kilcourse &amp; Rowen, 2014, p. ii). Almost a year later we conducted the same study again (Moes &amp; Van Vliet, 2014) to see if there were any differences. In the course of almost a year not much has changed, but there were a few differences. The amount of stores that offered a loyalty program increased from 49% to 57%, more stores ask customers in store to use a certain Twitter hashtag (increase of 3% to 9%) and to visit their website (40% to 51%). Some things have also changed online. In webshops, customers are more frequently asked to use their mobile phone to complete a certain task (4% to 15%) and it is now even more common to give customers a full refund for returned goods ordered online than it already was (increase from 90% to 98%).</Content>

    <Content>The organisation domain in the STOF model concerns innovations in collaboration with other parties in the value chain and the organisation of the processes for delivering the service to the customer. An innovation that has been ongoing for somewhat longer in the value chain is what is known as 'fast fashion'. For many fashion retailers, the process commences with the supplier and designer who design a new collection a year beforehand. New collections are, for example, launched twice per year in the store, after which the consumer buys the clothing. With 'fast fashion' the starting point is the buying pattern of the consumers, which is monitored closely: what is popular, what is the big seller, et cetera. The store manager then places orders with designers on the basis of this information. The logistics process is configured in such a way that the new collection is on display in the store within two weeks. This involves higher logistics and production costs, but, on the other hand, only products are sold for which there is a demand, so they can be sold at full price, and little of the collection ends up in the sales. Examples of stores that use this process are Zara (Inditex), Peacocks and Forever21. This so-called chain reversal is seen as an important future strategy for physical stores (Molenaar, 2011).</Content>

Individual stores suddenly become e-tailers that can now profit from the power of online commerce. Boutiques can easily sign up by contacting Miinto.

For small, independent retailers it is difficult to compete online against the large platforms due to the costs and the knowhow required and also because it is difficult to attract sufficient consumers to a relatively unknown website or webshop. An increasing number of major players such as Amazon and Bol.com give small shops the possibility to use their platform. The benefit for such a platform is that their product range increases even further, and their position as a </Content>

    <Content> is strengthened. For the small retailers, they not only benefit from all kinds of webshop logistics processes (order fulfilment, secure payments) but the penetration to potential customers is increased many times compared to them having just their own webshop. In the fashion industry, the Scandinavian firm Miinto is a good example of this. This platform provides independent fashion retailers with their online webshop, which is part of the general catalogue of the platform. The fashion retailers can also ‘buy in’ other services from Miinto such as collection photography and transaction handling. Other examples are </Content>

At most, there are some demo products available in the store. An example of this is the Scottish retailer House of Fraser. The vast majority of the examples are, however, about delivery of products to customers. In fashion, delivery is one of the most important aspects of consumer satisfaction (Peters &amp; Witte, 2013). Customer satisfaction is not only an important criterion for paying a lot of attention to delivery; the costs are also important. In 2012, a quarter of the 88 million online orders resulted in a return, for fashion this was as high as 60%, while for electronics it was only 5% (PWC, 2013). Returns and the logistics surrounding them cost a lot of money. As long as it remains difficult to implement suitable sizing online and to properly convey the colour and texture properties returns will, for the time being, continue to be an important aspect of the service and the costs.</Content>

    <Content>Although several criteria play a role in delivery, such as speed, convenience, costs and reliability, for the consumer it appears that the ability to remain in control is important. Research shows that the ability to choose a fixed delivery time is the most important aspect (31%), followed by pick-up points from a local store (24%), next-day delivery (24%) and same-day delivery (8%) (PWC, 2013). Schut et al. (2014) also find in a study that being able to determine the time of delivery is an important criterion for the customer (90%), while this is only offered in 12% of the cases. Free returns are also a wish that emerged, with around 60% of consumers stating that this is important. In reality, only 15% of deliveries can be returned free of charge. A further important aspect of returns is: quick and clear instructions about the return process and money credited to the customer’s account.</Content>

In the Netherlands, there are already around 6000 pick-up points (Schut et al., 2014). The ideal solution is not easy to find, so a customised solution sounds logical. However, there are many variables that have to be taken into account which, in any event, include the type of product (size, non-food/fresh/frozen, requirement for personal contact for signing or installation, for example) and the type of customer. One customer will prefer speed, another convenience or price. Harmonisation between product, customer and process does not only require good operational implementation, but also strategic choices about how to deal with deliveries (see Schut et al., 2014).</Content>

A development like Near Field Communication (NFC) incorporated in, amongst other things, bank cards or mobile phones makes it possible to make payments easily and quickly. Contactless payment systems are, like the name already suggest, systems whereby customers can pay for their goods without having to insert their card into a payment terminal. Signatures and PIN codes are also no longer a necessity. Just keep your card (or even mobile phone) close to the machine in order to pay. The embedded chip and antenna enable consumers to swipe their card over a reader at the point of sale. In the Netherlands you can pay amounts up to 25 euro in this manner.

    <Content>PowaTag is a new payment enabling technology that claims to seamlessly integrate the physical and online experience, thereby transforming the future of shopping. Powa Technologies introduced an app that enables consumers to purchase items directly via their smartphone while scanning items that they are interested in. With this app, consumers can purchase items from sources such as visual media, articles, announcements on events or radio- and television commercials. PowaTag combines mobile commerce with bluetooth geolocation technology, which makes it possible to buy items impulsively. Impulse buying is facilitated in this way. By scanning the item, which must be available in PowaTag’s database of course, the product is recognised and can then be purchased by the user. Giving personal information, such as your name and billing information (just like one would do at a regular webshop), enables the customer to buy the item. Additionally, (physical) retailers can send special offers to consumers that are near to a site equipped with PowaTag bluetooth beacons. And as you can already guess, PowaTag also tracks what consumers actually do and purchase with the app.</Content>

Sharing personal goods (car, telephone, clothing) is indeed something completely different to sharing digital goods or your tastes (Spotify, LibraryThing). It is expected that 'sharing' will play a less significant role in fashion because consumers say they are less willing to share clothes (Shopping2020, 2014a).</Content>

  <CharacterStyleRange AppliedCharacterStyle="$ID/NormalCharacterStyle">
    <Content>Almost all interviewed fashion retailers say that social media are an important communication channel for their business. Reasons to use these channels differ at a variety of levels. First, there is the practical level. As accounts on Facebook, Pinterest and Twitter are free of charge, it obviously cannot hurt to try. Online presence is guaranteed. This applies to almost all fashion retailers and is often used to present the collection visually. Here, social media are used as a channel to present the collection and activities. Then, there is the second, somewhat more strategic argument. Online activities on for example Facebook and Instagram are visible to retailers, which enable them to monitor responses, views, likes and so on, and act directly on this information. Here, social media are used to monitor how online readers react to and interact with (potential) customers. The third and last argument is a clear strategic argument that shows that digital is part of the organisation’s heart. Social media are part of a multi-channel strategy and the retailer wants to be relevant to its target group by presenting different promotional campaigns to different target groups. “Digital media are not only cheaper, but you can also target them a lot better and hence calculate the ROI more easily” (Anonymous retailer H, 2014). Sometimes collections are also sold via other webshops (such as Zalando, Wehkamp) in order to ensure that retailers do not miss the opportunity to make contact with a (potential) customer. Because, as one retailer puts it: “Customers choose the channel where they are at that specific moment. As a company, you have to follow your customers, you have to be where they are” (idem).</Content>

    <Content>Social media also involve challenges for the retailers.

Or what to do with fake accounts, promising discounts and free gifts that are not available? What to do with the comments and data that it produces? When do you know when you are doing well? Does 10,000 likes represent good positioning? A lot of questions arise about how to deal with the (potential) customer, how to create a good dialogue, how to use the data that companies receive and what kind of actions should be related to it. What percentage of those 10,000 likes will actually buy something of your brand? Recommend your brand? Or discourage others to buy something of your brand? The interviewed retailers are whistling in the dark.</Content>

    <Content>All of the innovations that have been mentioned are ultimately aimed at adding value for the consumer. However, not all consumers are the same. A party game that is just as entertaining as predicting technological developments is characterising consumers. This is not the exclusive domain of the retail sector. Museum and archive visitor types have been introduced such as sniffers, grazers, excavators, snackers, educators, nomads, butterflies and grasshoppers (Van Vliet, 2009). The shopping public has to tolerate less poetic designations and more Tarantino-like names such as 'the keeper', 'the banker', 'the hunter' and 'the courier' (Sansolo, 2012). Characterising the consumer or the shopper – the person who makes the actual purchase – has a history going back around 60 years. In Stone’s first typology, devised in 1954, the characterisations of the economic shopper (oriented towards for price and quality) and the apathetic shopper (shopping is a necessity and a chore) had already appeared (Westbrook &amp; Black, 1985). The importance of a shopper typology is that it gives the retailer the possibility to make better decisions about products offered and special offers (Westbrook &amp; Black, 1985).</Content>

Going shopping is pleasurable, and possibly transgressive and excessive: you may spend too much time or too much money. Doing the shopping, on the other hand, suggests an obligation or a regular routine. ‘The' shopping implies something both planned and limited: the definite article, with no extras or deviations. Going shopping points to fashion, clothes and leisure; doing the shopping is food shopping, for the most part regarded as a chore. Food is necessary, fashion is fun and spontaneous.&quot; (Bowlby, 1997, p. 102).</Content>

    <Content>Lehtonen &amp; Mäenpää (1997) described these two types of shoppers in more detail by contrasting them with each other (see Table 2). This distinction does not say that both forms cannot occur simultaneously: instrumental aims can play a role when going shopping, and when doing the shopping we can also amuse ourselves (Falk &amp; Campbell, 1997).

For example, the report makes a distinction between the shopper who regards shopping as a necessity and the shopper who regards shopping as a pleasurable activity. The study also raises an aspect that Lehtonen &amp; Mäenpää (1997) used in their characterisation of these two types of shoppers and introduces it as a separate dimension: planned/prepared versus unplanned/spontaneous.

    <Content>The descriptions of the different shoppers remain an eclectic mishmash of psycho-demographic characteristics. There are at least two distinct alternative views that can provide a sharper picture of the different types of shoppers. The first alternative is to look at the underlying motives. A study like the one by Westbrook &amp; Black (1985) shows that a focus on underlying motivations reveals a more differentiated picture of the 'recreational', 'economic' and 'apathetic' shopper than is often depicted. However, there is little agreement about the underlying motivations of shoppers (also see Lesser &amp; Kamal, 1991). Performing a meta-analysis of the studies already conducted, comparable with the meta-analysis of studies on the motivations of visitors to festivals (Van Vliet, 2012) seems to be a logical step forward in this discussion.</Content>

    <Content>A second alternative is to look at 'consuming practices', in other words the characterisations of shopping patterns: 'What do people do when they consume?'. Those patterns do vary considerably between people and situations such that it would be inadequate to explain them exclusively on the basis of the (economic) benefit and the (symbolic) significance of the object that is being consumed (Holt, 1995), or on the basis of fixed types of shoppers (GfK, 2013). According to Holt (1995), consumption has to be regarded as a form of social act where people use consumption objects in different ways. He concludes that there are four classifications of such practices based on two axes: the structure of consuming (focused on the object or focused on the interpersonal) and the purpose of consuming (a purpose in itself, in other words, 'autotelic' or instrumental for another purpose). This leads to four types of metaphors for describing the practices, which in Holt’s study is explained by means of the 'consumption' of a baseball game (Figure 3):</Content>

    <Content>Discriminating different stages in the consuming process, possibly comes across as a compulsory, linear and rational process. Of course, enough examples can be found where the customer journey is not linear and the shopper does not always act purposefully: &quot;there is a tendency to present the shopper as both an information-processor, a problem-solver and a rational maximiser of utility. The limitations of such a model have long been known. Apart from the a priori nature of the assumptions that they contain, such perspectives ignore all the evidence that shows (…) that problem-solving behaviour is a relatively rare occurrence, and that habitual behaviour is a far more common feature of consumer behaviour.&quot; (Hewer &amp; Campbell, 1997, p. 188). However, this does not detract at all from the conceptualising for recognising different phases - we just have to take into account a much more dynamic process. Furthermore, the fact that all kinds of unconscious processes that can be manipulated play a role in the customer journey does not mean that the consumer has become entirely 'irrational' (Maas, 2013). That would be throwing the baby out with the bathwater.</Content>

    <Content>) (Schut et al., 2014). Although this appears to be a logical addition it is necessary to realise that we are dealing with two processes: a consumer process and a supplier/retailer process, which are not organised in the same way. The consumer is, of course, also involved in a delivery, but clicking a button on a website to have the package delivered to a local branch is somewhat different to the fulfilment of this order. From a retailer's perspective, marketing is more likely to look like the following: 'create demand, identify where product could be purchased, expose and engage the shopper, capture transaction data, apply lessons learned to the next marketing action' (Blatt, 2012). The two perspectives or processes are difficult to understand in one 'journey', just like some concepts are reasoned more from the customer perspective (omni-channel) and others more from the retailer perspective (cross-media) (see Van Vliet, 2014). The fact that the customer process and the retailer process ‘touch’ is obvious, and has recently been expressed in the increasingly popular term 'touchpoints' (Shopping2020, 2014b). However, a clear definition of the term touchpoints is lacking: theoretical embedding, conceptual definition and operationalization are still rarely encountered. Furthermore, the question arises about where touchpoints differ from the ‘old’ term of 'service encounter' as 'a period of time during which a consumer directly interacts with a service' (Clarke &amp; Schmidt, 1995).</Content>

    <Content>A major issue that is mentioned during the interviews is the notion of personalisation, in many different forms and expressions. Fashion retailers clearly mention the importance of ‘personal’ contact with customers, whether physically or digitally. It seems that boutiques tend to have a preference for personal contact in its physical form, partly because they state that this is one of their brand values, which reinforces their business proposition. Physical personalisation exists in the form of personal advice, VIP treatments and exclusive loyal customer events in the store. Digital personalisation is often related to differentiation in promotions, which can be accomplished by membership cards or insights into the buying history of customers. Some retailers mention using more innovative technologies to do this, such as interactive mirrors, but also explain that this is not something that is appropriate for their budget. They are, however, interested in it, and some of them follow developments very closely.</Content>

    <Content>An important shift was therefore noticeable in recent years: it is less about branding and push-strategies, and more about listening to your customer and what a brand and its products can do for them (JamJam, 2014). “It’s important to build a relationship with the customer and that they become a fan of your brand. Then they become ambassadors of your brand when they are sharing their experiences about you on their Facebook page (Anonymous retailer H, 2014).

    <Content>There are also a couple of challenges involved with regard to personalisation. There is the discussion on privacy issues and regulations that might obstruct obtaining data that could really add value to one’s personalised offering (see section ‘Shopping in 2020’). Besides that, if fashion retailers really want to offer personalised promotions, the retailers would have to be able to follow the customers in all channels: “Sometimes customers come into my store and tell me: I really like this jacket. But if I order this online, I can get it for 15 Euros less. What can you do about that?” A true story, told by a retailer in Zeeuws-Vlaanderen (Bomont). Customers are increasingly aware of the possibilities that they have online – and offline – and apparently feel free to start negotiating about in-store prices. Although interviewed retailers in Amsterdam did not share these experiences, they do confirm the difficulties around online pricing and how to survive in such a fickle environment. Some retailers mention that their added value is therefore to offer that extra service, such as free clothing alteration or special events.</Content>

But the main issue with the changes in channels might not be that shops have the feeling that they are losing customers to online channels, but the fact that they are not able to track them. Merging on and offline channels is high on the priority list of the interviewed Amsterdam retailers. Not just to create rich profiles and learn more about the behaviour of customers and alter your strategy appropriately, but also to advise customers better: “When a customer comes in the physical store and is already logged in on the app as a member, then we are able to see her buying history and our staff can do a suggestion what she might also find interesting. [..] And if a customer is searching for a panty on the mobile website and later on a desktop, I would like to be able to recognise them and respond to it by offering them a discount. That is the ultimate goal in a multi-channel strategy” (Anonymous retailer H, 2014). Additionally, stores would have a better insight into whether customers actually just leave the store and buy an item elsewhere, or leave the store and buy </Content>

Merging channels therefore not only relates to better and personal offerings for customers, but also greater ability to divide sales targets into off and online channels. This will, no doubt, remain an issue in the upcoming years, as it is very hard to track the same customers both physically and digitally, especially when they do not possess a membership card.</Content>

    <Content>The question about the effect of (technological) developments in the near future and the question about who will make use of them, why and in which way, are necessary but relatively generic questions and are not specific for cross-media research. The actual developments do indicate that the question about the orchestration of all possibilities of, for example, a retailer communicating with a customer is one of increasing complexity and urgency (Van Vliet, 2008). It is expected that there will be further shifts in channel use in the coming years. In the Wolters study (2013), according to the experts the following channels will grow: social media (from 4% to 6% share), in-store online sales (from 5% to 8%) and generalist retailer webshops (from 15% to 19%) at the expense of brand and producer webshops (from 31% to 24%). By 2020, there will be greater use of tablets (from 22% to 33%) and smartphones (from 10% to 21%) as sales devices, and this will be at the expense of laptops (from 32% to 15%) and desktops (from 31% to 10%). For fashion, by 2020 the estimated share of sales via a tablet is 26% for clothing and 31% for shoes and personal lifestyle. This shifting of channel use will require organisations to adapt their cross-media strategy appropriately to secure the orchestration of all of the options offered by (media)channels. And who knows, maybe tablets will eventually be replaced by virtual salespersons.</Content>

    <Content>In a store you need staff. Gathering information from a salesperson is one of the benefits of physical stores. But in Australia they invented virtual salesmen. Would this work? It is best compared with a projector that projects a semi 3D-salesperson on an acrylic cut-out. Using the latest holographic projection technology, someone is filmed while delivering a presentation. The footage is then rear projected onto an acrylic cut-out that precisely matches the body shape of that person in order to give the impression of a semi-3D image. So it is not really a 3D hologram, but it looks like it. When finished, retailers can put the projector wherever they want. This ‘person’ can provide information about, for example, products. It can even ‘hold’ items like flyers or tablets. Reasons stated by Vision2Watch why retailers should consider purchasing such a projector, are that it could “offer an exciting and promotional alternative to the tired old human being” and because “it perfectly delivers your advertising message (over and over)”.</Content>

    <Content>The multitude of communication channels enable stores to communicate with their customers in a variety of ways and at a variety of times (Rangaswamy &amp; Van Bruggen, 2005; Van Vliet, 2008). Using several channels also allows the possibility of providing improved service via channel integration, such as online ordering and offline collection, or offline returns of products ordered online. Online orientation and offline buying – known as webrooming - are undertaken by the vast majority of consumers (more than 80%); offline orientation and online buying – known as showrooming – is still considerably less, at just 44% for fashion (DigitasLBi, 2014). The Internet has specifically encouraged a cross-media approach because, for example, it has become very cost-effective to offer services and products through webshops. This service can result in greater customer satisfaction, increased loyalty, improved sales and larger market share. A cross-media approach has positive consequences for sales, consumers who use more channels buy more, they are more active, and they are more satisfied (Sharma &amp; Mehrotra, 2007): &quot;The average multi-channel consumer spends more than a single channel consumer. This is partly because multi-channel consumers have on average a higher income and spending pattern than other consumers. The exact increased amount in spending of multi-channel consumers ranges from two to ten times as much as single channel consumers.&quot; (Van Ameijden et al., 2012, p. 6). However, the generality of this statement is not encountered in all empirical studies (Teerling et al., 2007) and Wolters (2013), for example, finds that the omni-channel customer does, in fact, spend more but is less loyal. Retailers do say though that the expected increase in sales is the most important reason for a multi-channel strategy (Van Ameijden et al., 2012).</Content>

    <Content>Each channel has its type of consumers and its motivations for using that channel. Motivation for using a channel can be economic advantage, product range, convenience, social status, opportunity, freedom of choice, greater satisfaction, social interaction, et cetera. It is not just the motivation that can differ per channel; the loyalty displayed to a channel and the degree at which cross-buying occurs can also differ. The latter refers to the level of ‘reward’ for the consumer and the time that it takes (channel adaption duration) to switch from one channel to another. This switching pattern is a significant challenge (Weltevreden, 2012). The most commonly used ways of encouraging online visitors into a physical store are: 1) special offers online can also be used in the store, 2) the webshop looks like the store, 3) products ordered online are collected in the store. Conversely, the most commonly used ways of encouraging store visitors to go the webshop are: 1) URL visible in the store, 2) webshop and store look alike, 3) special offers in the store can also be used online (Van Ameijden et al., 2012). Fashion businesses still make little use of online strategies for encouraging store visits (Boels &amp; Weltevreden, 2013). An example of a similar looking webshop and physical store is Burberry, where the fundamental principle is that each element of the website is recreated offline (Williams, 2014).</Content>

    <Content>Consumers who still only use one channel for gathering information and deciding to buy are becoming a minority (Stone et al., 2002; Rangaswamy &amp; Van Bruggen, 2005; Teerling et al., 2007; DigitasLBi, 2014). However, harmonising and managing channels, for example, in order to link customer data across different channels appears to be a significant challenge. The result of this is that returning customers are not recognised (whilst, for example, they are entitled to a discount) or customers are bombarded with the same information from different channels. It is about the integration of cultures, technologies, marketing strategies, elements of the organisation and understanding different consumer patterns; not exactly a trivial matter (PWC, 2007).</Content>

    <Content>Even more important: there are also negative ’drivers’ (Sharma &amp; Mehrotra, 2007). Firstly, the revenue drops when multiple channels are used: the revenues from a new channel are often lower than from existing channels. After all, those existing channels have the ‘easy’ customers tied to them. Furthermore, the costs of the acquisition and the maintenance of a new channel place pressure on the earnings, also because channels are still often maintained separately as far as the organisation is concerned due to their own (technical) infrastructure, staffing and management (Stone et al., 2002; Rangaswamy &amp; Van Bruggen, 2005). Secondly, there is ‘sales cannibalization’. In other words, the channels compete against each other for the total revenues. The most important way of preventing this is not to have price discrimination across different channels, to have complementary product ranges and to have an integrated stocking system (Van Ameijden et al., 2012).</Content>

    <Content>“There was a time when sales assistants at Burberry would have carried tape measures. These days, those working at the luxury retailer’s 545 stores, concessions, outlets and franchises across the world are rarely seen without iPads.” In the Burberry flagship store at Regent Street all sorts of new digital solutions are offered to the customer to enhance the experience. A ‘magic’ mirror tells shoppers more about the item they are currently carrying with them, mannequins wear the same outfits as shown on the website, there is a giant screen that can be used to show the latest shows and they even put a secret stage. The whole concept is to integrate off- and online to stimulate an immersive experience. In their video, Burberry explains that they want to tell authentic stories. And to tell authentic stories, they also believe that the language spoken is very important, and, as Angela Ahrendts puts it, “their [consumers] language was rapidly becoming digital”. Hence, Burberry decided it should create that authentic experience by using both physical and digital languages and use the best of both to make it an immersive experience.</Content>

    <Content>How does it work? When entering the digital store, shoppers can, for instance, get extra information on garments if they carry them while standing in front of a ‘magic’ mirror. The mirror, able to recognise RFID tags, notices that the garment is nearby and shows extra information that should increase customer interest. As one can also see in the video, a great immersive experience is created by the big screens that are everywhere – they have the ability to create a different world and make you totally forget that you’re actually in a retail store.

    <Content>The latter touches on a prominent concern in the retail sector: the role of the physical store. Times are difficult for the physical store. Newspapers regularly carry reports about the increasing number of empty stores and inner-city degeneration (Rijlaarsdam, 2013; Toonen, 2014) and unsettling reports are published about the loss of the high street (Erich, 2014). Reported causes for this are: the rise in online competition, direct selling by brand manufacturers, municipal policy, changing consumer buying patterns and a separation in the steps in the buying process as a result of which orientation, selection and transaction no longer necessarily have to take place in the physical store: &quot;These days customers buy in a different way than they did in the past. Firstly we look on the Internet at what we want to buy, the prices and we compare products and then we decide where we want to buy. Buying in the store has become a choice and no longer a necessity.&quot; (Molenaar, 2011, p. 10).</Content>

This has caused a shift in budget to in-store advertising, eye-catching packaging and in-store special offers. However, the percentage of impulse buys is substantially lower (44%) and the majority of people use a shopping list (Levy, 2012). With regard to the 70%, Van Gaalen (2012) says: “We would love this to be true, but it does seem a bit high, doesn't it?&quot; (p. 131).

    <Content>All over the world, stores pop up that are aimed at short-term sales. That is, creating a temporary venue where customers can buy, for instance, niche products. According to Wikipedia, Vacant (LA) was the first company that began to experiment with the concept. The store ‘pops up’ within only a couple of days, for it to quickly melt away (within a couple of days or weeks). As such, these temporary sales venues are very suitable for seasonal specials. In a time where some brick-built stores can no longer pay their rent, partly due to growing online sales, cities are having to deal with increasing numbers of empty outlets. Empty stores and offices don’t make anybody happy. They are even a little bit depressing. So why not transform them into a temporary store? This is a great opportunity for brands that do not want to spend great amounts of money on a monthly basis, but do want to sell seasonal products, or just get temporary attention. In the Netherlands, specific websites or apps help those interested in setting up a temporary store. These websites show where vacant and available stores are located. An example is Popupsqsuare. Popupsquare is a platform for pop-up stores. Pop-up queen Caroline de Jager initiated the concept, because she believes that nobody benefits from vacancy. Not the consumer, not the owner of the property and not the retailer. Popupsquare brings people together who are looking for an empty store with people who are offering an empty store. Becoming a member of popupsquare.nl makes it possible to see other peoples’ posts. Then you fill in your own profile and let others know what you are looking for or what you have to offer. If you’re really serious, you also write down your plan for the store.</Content>

For digital products, such as music downloads and streaming (iTunes, Spotify) and the purchase of tickets (travel, concerts) it seems that the argument is already won because this is where the disappearance of physical stores is happening the most.</Content>

    <Content> The concept of the 'endless aisle' in the store is intended to counteract the normally limited product range by also presenting the online product range to the in-store customer, but with the added benefit, for example, of advice from the store staff. An example is the Chasing shop in Amsterdam. Another crossover is to remove the queues at the tills in the physical store by having a lot of staff in the store so that the customer can pay immediately (Apple Store in Amsterdam), or the endless searching in a supermarket for a product whilst it can be found immediately online: &quot;To illustrate the future role of the portability of mobile devices, consider a customer with a RFID-enabled mobile device that also contains a personal shopping list. When he walks into a grocery store, the store's RFID reader can identify him and match his preferred brands to the listed items.

It is abandoned, because there is simply nothing to do. Digital storefronts can contribute to lively surroundings, even when stores are closed or empty. Digital storefronts are touchscreen store windows made from connected glass. These windows provide customers with a virtual shop in a real mall or shopping street. It is interactive and never closed. It is online shopping, with an offline experience. How does it work? Customers see these digital store windows and can swipe through a virtual collection. Whether it’s after closing time or not and whether the store behind the window is empty or very crowded, this digital storefront is always open. If customers see something that they like, they can hit the ‘order’ button and a link will be sent to their mobile phone. That way, people can pay in private with Paypal, for example.

This is also what consumers themselves say are the most important reasons for continuing to go to the shops: seeing and trying the products, personal in-store advice from the staff, immediate availability of the product as well as special in-store offers (DigitasLBi, 2014). For consumers, the most important reasons for not ordering online are: want to see/feel products before buying (37%), delivery costs too high (36%), concern about quality of products (26%) and the ease of sending returns (20%) (Schut et al. (2014). Capitalising on the physical location / environment of the store results in all kinds of scenarios for achieving the best possible response to the unique location and the consumer who is present there, such as in inner cities and at train stations, workplaces and events (see INretail, 2014).</Content>

    <Content>A recurring word is ‘experience’: shopping must be an indelible experience and must mainly be enjoyable (Molenaar, 2011; Rijlaarsdam, 2013; Van Heusden, 2013; Shopping2020, 2014b). Occasionally, it seems that naivety strikes and it is merely a question of a coffee corner and a smile from the staff: &quot;Think, for example, of a social corner with newspapers, magazines and coffee, a smile from friendly staff, videos and music in the store, nice posters and terminals where purchases can be made. It’s not so difficult&quot; (Molenaar, 2011, p. 21). The fact that it is somewhat more complicated than this is evident from, for example, the experience of the J.C. Penney clothing store. This department store brought in Apple’s top manager Ron Johnson in order to address falling visitor numbers and sales. The restyling resulted in an interior like an Apple retail store: austere white cabinets, bright light, natural varnished wooden floor, lots of space and no special offers. The customers fled en masse to competitor Target (from where Johnson was once headhunted by Apple!) on the other side of the shopping centre. Exit Apple big shot (Van Heusden, 2013).</Content>

    <Content>In the above description of the (future) retail landscape we have seen a lot of sub-problems and partial solutions and a number of mantras such as ‘experience’. In order to view the developments, problems and opportunities in a more structured manner we need an integrated framework – one that distinguishes the relevant components, establishes relationships between them and generates with hypotheses that can be tested. This integrated framework will have to relate to the 'service encounter', the contact moment between customer and service. The way in which the customer ‘enters’ the moment is important (expectations, mood, state of mind, etc.), as well as how the service is orchestrated by the provider. From the point of view of cross-media, it is interesting to see what role the physical environment or store plays in relation to the strong forces of digitalisation and new media. The theoretical framework that we shall use for this is the conceptualisation of 'servicescapes'.</Content>

    <Content> In her study, Bitner shed light, from a marketing perspective, on the influence of the physical environment on consumers and staff. To indicate this, Bitner used the term servicescape: “All of the objective physical factors that can be controlled by the firm to enhance (or constrain) employee and customer actions.” (1992, p. 65). The most succinct expression of the role of the servicescape is in service environments such as hotels, restaurants, banks, stores and hospitals. These are typical service organisations where consumers and staff have direct contact in complex and decorated environments. The services are produced and consumed simultaneously and the consumers are, as it were, 'in the factory': a dental treatment, a visit to the hairdresser, eating out and going to a concert are examples of this. This is in contrast to services such as a self-service laundrette or filling station where, in fact, it is only the consumer that acts, and where services can be delivered reasonably ‘lean’ like the products sold on the market or a motoring breakdown service.</Content>

    <Content>Servicescapes are about a space manipulated by people. That manipulation can take on many forms, for example, light, temperature, furniture, music, colour, room layout, symbols, artefacts, etcetera.

    <Content>Ambient conditions. These are features of the space such as temperature, light, sound, music, smell and other aspects that have an immediate effect on our senses. Many studies into workplaces show that these factors have an influence on staff performance and satisfaction. Consumers are also influenced by these factors: the tempo of music in supermarkets influences the tempo of shopping, the length of stay in the supermarket and the amount spent; in restaurants customers stay longer and they drink more when the tempo of the music is slower. Familiarity with the music also has an influence: if customers do not know the music in a store they think they have been shopping longer than is actually the case. The same applies to a pleasant smell: consumers think they have not been in the store for as long as they actually have been and they also give a more positive evaluation of the store. Modalities also reinforce each other: a combination of a Christmas smell and Christmas music has a stronger effect than if they are experienced individually. This cross-modality is, however, complex: music that is or is not congruent with the product influences, product recognition and the likelihood of a sale (also see Peck &amp; Childers, 2008).</Content>

    <Content>Spatial layout and functionality. This is about the spatial arrangement of fittings (furniture, plants, etc.) and their mutual positioning. It is also about the support that the spatial layout gives to achieving specific aims. An example of this is whether the checkouts in a store are clearly visible and easily accessible for the customers so that they can pay quickly. The addition of plants and flowers in public spaces and benches for sitting on sometimes has substantial consequences for behaviour in that space. However, not much research has been conducted into the question of how consumers experience these types of manipulation. One example is a study on the behaviour of business people that travel regularly and often stay in hotels. They seem to make hotel rooms look more like home by moving the furniture until the arrangement is ‘like home’. Another trick they use to feel more at home is personalising the room by removing all objects and signs that refer to a hotel and replacing them with their own objects (Bardhi &amp; Askegaard, 2011). It is a known fact that people in spaces where they have to follow a route, walk faster through the second section. This applies to museums (Van Vliet, 2009) and to stores as well: &quot;In general, as shoppers get nearer and nearer the checkout they shop faster and faster - using most of their 'leisure time' at the beginning of the trip. The phenomenon is so pronounced and regular that we refer to it as 'the checkout magnet'.&quot; (Sorensen, 2012, p. 57/58).</Content>

    <Content>Customers will react to the environment in a specific manner. Bitner also divides these reactions into three dimensions: cognitive, emotional and physiological dimensions. The influence of the physical environment on the cognition, emotion and physiology can differ in strength and in ‘direction’ (positive or negative), where that influence is partly determined by the personal and situational factors. Personality characteristics, such as ‘arousal-seeking’ indicate that some people specifically choose certain environments (bungee jumping, wild-water canoeing) and that they also experience these differently from what are known as arousal-avoiders (‘at home in front of the TV’). A person’s mood is also important: being tired after a frustrating day’s work instead of just returning from a relaxing weekend has an effect on how one experiences a busy restaurant. Bitner ultimately says that consumers can react to a space in two opposing ways: approach and avoidance. Approach is about wanting to stay in the space, investigate it and spend money in it and wanting to return to it. Avoidance is the opposite of that: want to go away, not wanting to return, having no interest in it, et cetera. Ezeh &amp; Harris (2007) also incorporate this aspect in their definition of servicescape: “The design of the physical environment (with or without customer input) housing the service encounter, which elicits internal reactions from customers leading to the display of approach or avoidance behaviours.” (p. 61).</Content>

    <Content>Incidentally, the servicescape does not just influence individual behaviour, but also the nature, quality and the development of social interactions that take place within the space. The layout of the physical space has a demonstrable effect on communication patterns, group formation and group dynamics. Particular environments invoke predictable social behaviour and activate conventions about how to interpret the situation (Goffman, 1974). A theatre, a train compartment and a waiting room at the dentist all have their conventions and behaviours that are influenced by the specific physical layout of these rooms.</Content>

    <Content>Bitner’s model of servicescapes (Figure 4) is generally considered to be relevant (Eroglu &amp; Machleit, 2008), but, strangely enough, the empirical research into the role of servicescapes is relatively limited (Turley &amp; Milliman, 2000; Ezeh &amp; Harris, 2007). Furthermore, the empirical research that has been conducted is often just about the influence of a single element, for example, smell or colour “…to the extent that little is known about the global configurations of aspects of the servicescape” (Ezeh &amp; Harris, 2007, p. 79). Or it only focuses on part of the model, such as demonstrating that the emotional state of shoppers is a predictor of buying patterns (Donovan et al., 1994) or the discovery of irritating aspects in the shop environment (D'Astous, 2000). The research that has been conducted is still focused on causal micro-relationships and not on the ‘Gestalt’ or the visitors ‘holistic’ experience.

    <Content>Conceptually, there are also remarks that can be made about the Bitner model, for example, with regard to the social factors. Bitner explicitly omits these as part of the servicescape and only refers to them as a resultant within her framework. Other researchers do postulate the social factors as a significant influencing dimension of the servicescape because social interaction constitutes part of the space. In addition, there are also new research areas that have presented themselves and which Bitner could not have foreseen, namely those of the online servicescapes, which are also known as e-scapes.</Content>

    <Content> (Van Vliet, 2012) there is a proposal to characterise a specific sub-class of servicescapes as experiencescapes. Experiencescapes are servicescapes that are configured for the visitor experience. The layout of stores, museums, sports stadia, restaurants, shopping centres, city parks and tourist attractions no longer focuses exclusively on the most efficient and effective service delivery but increasingly emphasises creating the experience. We no longer drink beer in a pub but rather in an Irish pub or the Hard Rock café, we don’t eat in a normal restaurant but rather in the jungle of the Rainforest Café and we shop in the Wild West themed shopping centres that promise a rich shopping experience’. Entire districts (China Town, Old Pasadena), cities (Las Vegas), regions (Merrie England) and even islands (Hawaii) consist of ‘cardboard’ nostalgia where we can re-experience the real, authentic China, England or whatever.

Recurring research questions for this will be: What is the 'global configuration' of an experiencescape? What relationship is there between this configuration and the consumer/visitor experience? What is the role of digital media in the experiencescape and when, how and to what extent does it influence the configuration of those experiencescapes and the experience? What are the differences between the sub-categories of experiencescapes (festivals, museums, stores) and what relationship do they have with the experience?

    <Content>Insights and Challenges Amsterdam Fashion Retailers: Experiences</Content>

  <CharacterStyleRange AppliedCharacterStyle="$ID/NormalCharacterStyle">
    <Content>A fourth insight revealed in the interviews with Amsterdam fashion retailers is the recurring topic of experience. With regard to the role of the physical stores, the interviewed fashion retailers are very clear: “You still need physical stores, because customers want to feel the product or get advice from the staff” (Anonymous retailer M, 2014). But they do stress the necessity of service, just giving that extra special feeling when in the store. A couple of retailers specifically mention the strength of a combination of both digital and physical in this respect: “I think that people really want to try on the clothes first, which they will do in store. Then they walk out the store, take a couple of days to think it through, and then order it online. You have to offer that service” (Anonymous retailer I, 2014).</Content>

<ParagraphStyleRange AppliedParagraphStyle="ParagraphStyle/Paragraph">
  <CharacterStyleRange AppliedCharacterStyle="$ID/NormalCharacterStyle">
    <Content>Service and experience are aspects that are important according to all retailers. “The option to order for free, give them coffee, tea or even Prosecco when they are inside the store, or being able to quickly alternate clothing in our own sewing atelier; it all matters” (Anonymous retailer V, 2014). And we all are too well aware of those special ‘membership’ days, where membership card holders get access to sample sales, special events or evening sales.</Content>

</ParagraphStyleRange>
<ParagraphStyleRange AppliedParagraphStyle="ParagraphStyle/Paragraph">
  <CharacterStyleRange AppliedCharacterStyle="$ID/NormalCharacterStyle">
    <Content>But a couple of retailers really want to take it to the next level. “My dream is to open up a big store. With a huge table, right in the middle, so that people can read the newspaper or browse through a collection of (art)books that they can then also buy here. The store will be all about giving the customer that extra special experience. So when customers come to the store, they sense a great atmosphere, they can touch, feel and fit the clothing and relax at the same time” (Anonymous retailer M, 2014). Another retailer (V) is really curious about the possibilities of the interactive mirror. She feels that the interactive mirror provides customers with more service when searching for the perfect outfit. She even believes that interactive mirrors can take over – to some extent – the activities of a sales assistant. Which seems to contradict one of the strengths of the physical store: personal advice from real people.</Content>

<ParagraphStyleRange AppliedParagraphStyle="ParagraphStyle/Paragraph">
  <CharacterStyleRange AppliedCharacterStyle="$ID/NormalCharacterStyle">
    <Content>An interactive full-length mirror is just one of the many innovations that are currently on offer in the fashion retail sector that will doubtlessly force the retailer to ask himself ‘What am I to do with it?’ Is such a technological innovation to be used as a PR stunt in order to boost the image of being an innovative organisation; is it a means of drawing attention in an unconventional way and thus achieving positive customer attitude (Hutter &amp; Hoffmann, 2014); is it an alternative to existing processes or can it be integrated into existing processes? Even aside from the costs and revenues, this is already a stressful situation that is difficult to avoid because technological innovations are ongoing. As a deer staring into the headlights of an approaching car, many retailers go numb, and it is, therefore, not surprising that: “Many retailers are restrained about introducing new technologies” (PWC, 2014). A conclusion reflected in our observations of innovative behaviour of fashion retail stores in Amsterdam and the interviews with Amsterdam retailers. The interviewed retailers were often struggling with their ‘omni-channel’ strategies, especially because retailers find it hard to predict which innovations could really benefit them. Fashion retailers are aware of the fact that consumers do a lot online, but the knowledge of how to respond to that was not always present. We think the quote taken from Kilcourse &amp; Rowen (2014) is the most to the point in this case: &quot;There is a vast distance between retailers' understanding of the value of many of today's technical solutions and actual use - even though many of those technologies have been available for quite some time&quot; (p. ii).</Content>

    <Content>If we skip the recurring discussion on what to call it (cross-media, transmedia, omni-channel, et cetera), the underlying drive is to find a conclusive answer or final understanding about how organisations should use media as an instrument in their communication with and service development for their customers. Formulated in this way it reveals that, despite all new semantics, the underlying questions have not really changed. Organisations are making (strategic) decisions about how to put all kinds of media to use in order to attract, inform, persuade and lock-in customers to whatever goal they set themselves. Due to a plethora of media occurrences, each with their particular characteristics and usages, and the many contextual variables that are apparent in any offer an organisation makes, there is a monumental task in figuring out what works and what does not work at a certain time for a particular consumer. This task has been referred to as ‘orchestration’ (Van Vliet, 2008). Different concepts can be regarded as being different interpretations of, or, different perspectives on this orchestration. Cross- media focuses on the interrelatedness of the various media or channels used in the orchestration; Transmedia or ‘sequential storytelling’ (Kleverlaan, 2014) focuses on the storyline being told throughout this orchestration; multi-channeling looks at the unique channel features of each channel and their overall contribution to the set targets.</Content>

<ParagraphStyleRange AppliedParagraphStyle="ParagraphStyle/Paragraph">
  <CharacterStyleRange AppliedCharacterStyle="$ID/NormalCharacterStyle">
    <Content>This orchestration is in the hands of the organisation. From the specific goals organisations set themselves, they orchestrate media (channels) in order to reach those goals, be they economical gain, cultural enlightenment or societal well-being. Orchestration is an intentional act, meaning it is directed at someone. That someone is persuaded, consciously or unconsciously, by the offering or seeks out the offering actively based on their own agenda, or should we say their own orchestration of needs, wants, intentions and habitual behaviour. The point to make is that there are two sides to the service encounter: the orchestration of an offering by the organisation and the experience of that offering by the customer. Sometimes it seems that these two sides are not taken fully into account, especially their differences that are grounded in respectively organisational capabilities and psychological constellations. Based on these two sides of the service encounter, one can argue that the omni-channel concept represents the viewpoint of the customer’s experience far more, and the concept of multi-channel is a point of view far more related to the organisation. Ignoring this two-sidedness, one can easily dismiss multi-channel as ancient history when taking a consumer-centred approach (Dorf, 2010; 2011; Ter Haar, 2014). Of course the two sides must meet - the so-called service encounter, or to use a more popular contemporary term ‘touchpoint’ -, which in some ways is the moment of truth regarding the continuation of the organisation and customer loyalty.</Content>

    <Content>Applied research can help organisations to formulate a consistent and robust orchestration and find ways of translating this into a specific service offering to customers. Such a focus obliges us to investigate concepts like media, cross-media context, experiences and services: an extensive research agenda by any measure. The servicescape concept has been introduced for this which, with a number of adaptations and expansions, forms a promising framework for analysing service encounters and helping retailers to find answers to pressing questions on renewal of their business.</Content>
